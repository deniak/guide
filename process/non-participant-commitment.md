title: Non participant commitment
toc: no

This is Team guidance for implementation of [Process 6.2.6](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#contributor-license). If you have any IPR questions, and for substantial contributions, please contact [team-legal](mailto:team-legal @ w3.org).

When a non-Member (or not-yet-identified Member) makes a pull request contribution to a W3C Working Group repository, the repository manager tool flags it for review and sends them an email with [this text](https://github.com/w3c/ash-nazg/blob/master/templates/affiliation-mail.txt) to the contributor, chairs, and team contacts.

1. If the contributor is a Member participating in the WG, link the GitHub account to the Member-affiliated W3C account and re-validate.

1. If the contributor is a Member not participating in the WG, first encourage them to join the WG. If they won't, and this is a one-off contribution, follow the flow below. 
  
1. If the contribution is non-substantive, e.g. fixing a typo, mark it as non-substantive (which clears the IPR flag).

1. If the contributor is not an affiliate of a current W3C Member, the Team follows up with them to see:

   - Do they work for an organization who should be a Member?

      1. Try to recruit them to membership
   
      1. Get a *non-participant license commitment* 

   - Are they independent?

      1. Should we invite them as an [Invited Expert](https://www.w3.org/invited-experts/)?
  
      1. Get a *non-participant license commitment* 
  
The text of the non-participant license commitment is implemented as a click-through. Note that this form is designed for occasional, one-off contributions. To make multiple substantive contributions, a person must join the group as a Member or IE participant.

=== DRAFT *non-participant license commitment* ===
 
"I [name], [organization], commit to license all my Essential Claims
both in the contribution [pull request # on spec], and that become
Essential Claims as a result of incorporating the contribution into the
draft that existed at the time of the contribution, on the terms
specified in section 5 of the W3C Patent Policy.[1]

I represent that I am legally entitled to grant the necessary licenses
for my contribution as described in the Patent Policy, especially in
Section 3.4 thereof. If my employer or any other party has rights to my
contributions, I represent that I have received permission to make the
relevant licensing commitments according to the W3C Patent Policy on
behalf of such party as if it had made the contribution under this
Agreement.

I agree to comply with the disclosure obligations to the extent of my
personal knowledge, as required by Section 6 of the Patent Policy.

Copyright Grant. I grant to you a perpetual (for the duration of the
applicable copyright), worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, copyright license, without any obligation for accounting
to me, to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, sublicense, distribute, and implement any Contribution
to the full extent of my copyright interest in the Contribution.

This Agreement shall be deemed to have been entered into and shall be
interpreted and governed in all respects by the laws of The Commonwealth
of Massachusetts and the United States of America.
