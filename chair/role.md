The [W3C Team](https://www.w3.org/Process#ref-for-team%E2%91%A2%E2%91%A6) appoints (or re-appoints) a Chair (or more than one co-Chair) for every Working Group and Interest Group ("Group"). The Chair's primary role is to facilitate [consensus](/policies/process/#Consensus)-building among Group members. The Chair works together with the W3C [Staff Contact](../teamcontact/role.html). Key roles of the Group Chair are listed below. Additional information on the role of the Group Chair is in the [W3C Process Document](/policies/process/#general-requirements).

## Chair Buddy System

The [Working Group effectiveness Task Force](https://github.com/w3c/wg-effectiveness) helped establish a Chair Buddy System by which experienced buddy-mentors help buddy-mentees.

Interested parties should subscribe to [chairbuddies@w3.org](mailto:chairbuddies@w3.org) ([Member-only archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-chairbuddies/)) and visit the dedicated [Chair Buddy System page](buddy.html).

### What to look for when choosing a chair

*The following bullets based on suggestions from [Joseph Reagle](https://www.w3.org/People/Reagle/)*

- Experience in chairing similar groups, committees, and/or conferences;
- Previous participation or technical contributions in related communities;
- Ability to satisfy the time commitment (from you and/or your organization/management);
- Familiarity or willingness to learn W3C Process and document formatting rules;
- Familiarity with the [W3C Code of Conduct](/policies/code-of-conduct/);
- Ability to keep the Working Group "in Charter", both for technical and IPR issues;
- Ability (both actual and perceived by the Working Group -- including potential competitors) to forge consensus fairly and without bias from your affiliation/employer and, sometimes, even your own technical positions.

* * *

The team contact should arrange for the Chair and the [W3C Team](https://www.w3.org/Process#ref-for-team%E2%91%A2%E2%91%A6) to meet (by phone if necessary) to make sure they're on the same wavelength about things like:

- where the group's work fits into [Web Architecture](/TR/webarch/)
- where does it fit with other groups
- testing, test suites ... generating tests as you come to each
- responsibility not just to the group -- working toward consensus of the whole community
- cost of delaying wider consensus - negotiating your reviews and really getting in touch with people - versus time to market and specification relevance
- formal objections, i.e. the tricky bits of W3C process
